# Principal Component Analysis (PCA) Project

## Overview

The Principal Component Analysis (PCA) Project is a data analysis and dimensionality reduction endeavor. In this project, we leverage PCA, a popular technique in machine learning and data science, to explore and transform high-dimensional data into a more manageable and insightful format. This project includes web-based tools powered by Flask and FastAPI to visualize and interact with PCA results.

## Project Components

### Backend Servers

- **Flask Server (server.py):** The Flask-based backend server is one of the central components of this project. It handles incoming requests, PCA computations, and communicates with the web interface.

- **FastAPI Server (server2.py):** Another key component is the FastAPI-based backend server, which manages incoming requests, PCA calculations, and interfaces with the web component.

### Web Interface

- **HTML Templates (templates/):** The project incorporates HTML templates for the web interface, providing a user-friendly environment for inputting data and visualizing PCA results.

- **CSS Styles (static/css/):** CSS files located in the static folder are responsible for styling the web interface, ensuring an appealing and user-centric design.

### Data Analysis and Dimensionality Reduction

- **PCA Implementation (pca.ipynb):** The Jupyter Notebook contains code for performing Principal Component Analysis. PCA helps reduce the dimensionality of data while preserving essential information, making it easier to visualize and understand complex datasets.
